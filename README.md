# Cognichip_NetworkArbiter
Cognichip Hackathon submission files for Gary Guan (xg2523@nyu.edu) and Az Li (azli@nyu.edu) 

We created a 4x4 and 8x8 arbiter design for use in a network switch. Both designs were created with the help of the Cognichip Artificial Chip Intelligence tool as part of the Cognichip hackathon. Thank you to the Cognichip team for providing the software and training.
